This repository contains the code associated with the paper titled "Diet-omics in the Study of Urban and Rural Crohn Disease Evolution (SOURCE)". The study aimed to investigate the impact of environmental changes and urbanization on the evolution of Crohn's Disease (CD) by analyzing various diet-omics domains.

## Abstract

Crohn's Disease (CD) has witnessed an increased prevalence due to globalization and urbanization, suggesting that environmental factors play a significant role in its development. The Study Of Urban and Rural CD Evolution (SOURCE) involved 380 participants and aimed to identify potential factors associated with the transition from rural to urban areas and CD. The study analyzed exposures, diet, ileal transcriptomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome of newly diagnosed CD patients and controls in rural and urban China and Israel. The findings revealed changes in gut microbial composition and metabolomics similar to those observed in CD among rural residents who spent more time in urban environments. Moreover, specific dietary factors (such as coffee, manganese, and vitamin D) were linked to potential protective effects, while metabolites associated with the microbiome were primarily connected to host immune modules, and diet-related metabolites were associated with host epithelial metabolic functions.
